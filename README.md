# <u>FACE DETECTION</u><br>

<p> This is a small deep learning project created using python and opencv.<br>
In this project we make use of the Cascade Classifiers and Haar Features.
<br>
The Cascade Classifier is a machine learning algorithm where we train a cascade function with tons of images.<br> These images are in two categories:<br>
* positive : This images contains the target object <br>
* negative images not containing the target object. <br>
